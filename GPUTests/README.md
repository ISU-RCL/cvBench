# GPU OpenCV Benchmark tests
 
This sub-folder contains the test code to benchmark vision kernels on GPU platform (i.e NVIDIA Jetson TX1/TX2).

Three different implementations of vision kernels can be evaualted on the GPU platform:
(1) OpenCV implemenation on the CPU core of the platform. 
(2) OpenCV implemenation with CUDA support.
(3) Nvidia VisionWork implementation.
