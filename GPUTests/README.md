## GPU OpenCV Benchmark tests
 
This sub-folder contains the test code for benchmarking vision kernels on GPU platforms such as: NVIDIA Jetson TX1/TX2.

* Three different implementations of vision kernels can be evaualted on the GPU platform:

1. OpenCV implemenation on the CPU core of the platform. 

2. OpenCV implemenation with CUDA support.

3. Nvidia VisionWork implementation.
